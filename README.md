# Deep Learning – Dense Neural Networks with Keras

This repository contains an applied Deep Learning assignment developed as part of my Master’s program.  
The project focuses on **building and training dense neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras** to solve a supervised learning problem on tabular data.

The objective of the work is educational, aimed at understanding the fundamentals of neural networks, their training process, and the impact of architectural and training choices.

## 📁 Dataset

The analysis uses the **Wine Quality dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
The dataset contains physicochemical properties of wine samples, with the target variable representing wine quality scores.

The data is used in a supervised learning context to predict quality based on numerical features.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

The notebook follows a structured deep learning workflow:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Feature–target separation
- Train–test split using `scikit-learn`

### 2. Model Definition
- Construction of **dense (fully connected) neural networks**
- Use of Keras Sequential API
- Definition of hidden layers and activation functions

### 3. Model Training
- Compilation of the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers
- Training over multiple epochs
- Monitoring of training behavior

### 4. Evaluation & Analysis
- Evaluation of model performance on unseen data
- Analysis of prediction quality
- Discussion of results and model limitations

The emphasis is placed on **understanding model structure and learning dynamics**, not on hyperparameter optimization or advanced architectures.
